Simple API that provides a way to manipulate some aspects of the SVG process image generated by jBPM5 Process Desiger: https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm-designer

The only supported feature, for now, is to change the background of Tasks elements. This could be useful for the use cases where you want to add to your application a graphical way to differentiate which tasks are already completed and which tasks are still in progress.
